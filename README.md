## Overview

`@dashx/react-native` is a thin, strongly-typed JavaScript facade over the native **[DashX iOS SDK](https://github.com/dashxhq/dashx-ios)** and **[DashX Android SDK](https://github.com/dashxhq/dashx-android)**. It gives your React Native app a single, consistent way to:

- **Identify** users and track their behavior across sessions.
- **Track events and screen views** with structured metadata.
- **Deliver push notifications** via Firebase Cloud Messaging on both platforms.
- **Handle deep links** (universal links on iOS, app links on Android) with structured navigation actions.
- **Fetch CMS content** by URN or via full-text / filter-based search.
- **Upload and fetch assets** (images, video) tied to your DashX records.
- **Manage user notification preferences** with a persistent, promise-based API.

All without writing a single line of platform-specific code in your app.

## Architecture

### High-Level Architecture

The SDK uses an **Impl + thin wrappers** pattern so that a single codebase supports both React Native's legacy bridge and the New Architecture's TurboModule system — without runtime branching and without duplicating business logic.

```mermaid

    end

### Dual-Architecture Support

Starting with **1.2.0**, `@dashx/react-native` is a **TurboModule** and supports both React Native architectures out of the box from a single install. The right wrapper is selected **at compile time** — no runtime branching, no consumer-side flags to flip beyond the standard RN `newArchEnabled` setting.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    START([Consumer App Build]) --> FLAG{newArchEnabled?}

    FLAG -->|false| OLDFLOW["Old Architecture Path"]
    FLAG -->|true| NEWFLOW["New Architecture Path"]

    OLDFLOW --> OLDJS["JS: NativeModules.DashXReactNative"]
    OLDFLOW --> OLDAND["Android: src/oldarch/<br/>extends ReactContextBaseJavaModule"]
    OLDFLOW --> OLDIOS["iOS: RCT_EXTERN_MODULE<br/>+ RCT_EXTERN_METHOD"]

    NEWFLOW --> NEWJS["JS: TurboModuleRegistry.get()"]
    NEWFLOW --> NEWAND["Android: src/newarch/<br/>extends NativeDashXReactNativeSpec<br/>(codegen)"]
    NEWFLOW --> NEWIOS["iOS: #ifdef RCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED<br/>+ getTurboModule: factory"]

    OLDAND --> SHARED["DashXReactNativeModuleImpl<br/>(shared business logic)"]
    NEWAND --> SHARED
    OLDIOS --> SWIFT["DashXReactNative.swift<br/>(shared business logic)"]
    NEWIOS --> SWIFT

    SHARED --> SDK1["DashX Android SDK"]
    SWIFT --> SDK2["DashX iOS SDK"]
```

**Why this matters:**

- ✅ **Same install, same API** — drop in `@dashx/react-native` once, works on both architectures.
- ✅ **Zero runtime branching** — the right code path is picked at build time by Gradle source sets (Android) and `#ifdef` (iOS).
- ✅ **No JS-side platform checks** — `TurboModuleRegistry.get()` auto-falls back to `NativeModules` on old arch.
- ✅ **Single source of truth** — business logic lives in one place per platform (`DashXReactNativeModuleImpl.kt` on Android, `DashXReactNative.swift` on iOS). The old-arch and new-arch wrappers are thin delegates.

### Method Call Lifecycle

Here's what happens when you call a method like `DashX.track('purchase', { amount: 100 })`:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as "Your App"
    participant JS as "index.js<br/>(Public API)"
    participant Spec as "TurboModule Spec"
    participant Bridge as "RN Bridge<br/>(JSI or Legacy)"
    participant Native as "Native Module<br/>(iOS or Android)"
    participant SDK as "DashX Native SDK"
    participant Backend as "DashX Platform"

    App->>JS: DashX.track('purchase', {amount: 100})
    JS->>JS: Validate event name (string)
    JS->>JS: Validate data (object | null)
    JS->>Spec: getNativeDashX().track(...)
    Spec->>Bridge: Marshal args
    Bridge->>Native: Invoke track method
    Native->>Native: Convert ReadableMap → Kotlin HashMap<br/>(or NSDictionary → Swift Dict)
    Native->>SDK: DashX.track(event, data)
    SDK->>Backend: HTTP POST /events
    Backend-->>SDK: 200 OK
    SDK-->>Native: return
    Native-->>Bridge: return
    Bridge-->>JS: return
    JS-->>App: void
```

**Key validation layers:**

1. **JavaScript layer** performs input validation (type checks, required fields) before touching the bridge. Invalid calls throw immediately without ever reaching native code.
2. **Native layer** handles the heavy lifting (JSON serialization, type conversion, SDK invocation).
3. **Platform gating** — iOS-only methods (`enableLifecycleTracking`, `processURL`, `trackNotificationNavigation`, `enableAdTracking`) early-return on Android at the JS layer. Android parity gaps (`uploadAsset`, `fetchAsset`, `requestNotificationPermission`, `getNotificationPermissionStatus`) reject with `EUNSUPPORTED`.

### Event Flow — Push Notifications & Deep Links

The SDK bridges native event sources (FCM on Android, Firebase + `UNUserNotificationCenter` on iOS) to JavaScript via a shared event-emitter pattern. You subscribe with `onMessageReceived` / `onLinkReceived` and get a standard `EmitterSubscription` back.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant FCM as "Firebase Cloud Messaging"
    participant Svc as "DashXFirebaseMessagingService<br/>(Android) or UNUserNotifDelegate (iOS)"
    participant Native as "Native Module"
    participant Bridge as "React Native Bridge"
    participant JS as "JS Event Emitter"
    participant App as "Your Listener"

    FCM->>Svc: Push payload arrives
    Svc->>Svc: Build bridge-safe payload
    Svc->>Native: emit('messageReceived', payload)
    Native->>Bridge: Dispatch event
    Bridge->>JS: NativeEventEmitter routes event
    JS->>App: callback(payload)

    Note over App: User taps notification
    App->>App: Deep link fires
    Native->>Bridge: emit('linkReceived', url)
    Bridge->>JS: NativeEventEmitter routes event
    JS->>App: callback(url)
```

**Usage:**

```ts
import DashX from '@dashx/react-native';

const messageSub = DashX.onMessageReceived((message) => {
  console.log('Push received:', message);
});

const linkSub = DashX.onLinkReceived((url) => {
  console.log('Deep link:', url);
});

// Remember to clean up on unmount
messageSub.remove();
linkSub.remove();
```

## Requirements

Before installing, make sure your project meets the following requirements:

| Requirement | Minimum | Recommended |
|---|---|---|
| **React Native** | 0.74.0 | 0.75+ |
| **React** | 17.0.0 | 18.x |
| **iOS Deployment Target** | 13.0 | 15.0+ |
| **Android `minSdkVersion`** | 26 | 26+ |
| **Android `compileSdkVersion`** | 34 | 34+ |
| **Node.js** | 16 | 18 LTS or newer |
| **Xcode** | 14 | 15+ |
| **Kotlin** | 1.8 | 1.9+ |

> [!WARNING]
> This SDK is **not compatible with Expo Go** because it uses native modules. If you use Expo, you must use a [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/).

> [!NOTE]
> From **1.2.0** the minimum supported React Native version is **0.74.0** (previously 0.71.0). TurboModule codegen matured in 0.74 — earlier versions have edge cases with `BaseReactPackage` and iOS Swift interop that are not worth supporting.

## Installation

Pick the path that fits how you work:

| Path | Who it's for | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| 🛠️ **[Manual Installation](#manual-installation)** | Developers who want to run each step themselves and understand what's happening | ~10 minutes |
| 🤖 **[AI Agent Installation](#ai-agent-installation)** | Developers using Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, or any AI coding assistant — copy a single prompt and let the agent do the whole setup end-to-end | ~2 minutes |

Both paths produce the same result — pick whichever you prefer.

---

### Manual Installation

🛠️ Run each step yourself in your project root.

#### 1. Install the package

Pick your package manager:

```sh
# npm
npm install @dashx/react-native

# yarn
yarn add @dashx/react-native

# pnpm
pnpm add @dashx/react-native
```

#### 2. Install iOS dependencies

```sh
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

If you are migrating an existing project to the New Architecture, also run:

```sh
cd ios && RCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED=1 pod install && cd ..
```

#### 3. Configure Firebase (required for push notifications)

Push notifications use Firebase Cloud Messaging on both platforms. Follow the standard Firebase setup:

- **iOS** — add `GoogleService-Info.plist` to your Xcode project.
- **Android** — add `google-services.json` to `android/app/` and ensure the Google Services Gradle plugin is applied.

See the [Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging) for platform-specific details.

#### 4. Enable New Architecture (optional)

If you want to opt into the New Architecture / TurboModule path:

- **Android** — in `android/gradle.properties`:
  ```properties
  newArchEnabled=true
  ```
- **iOS** — run `pod install` with `RCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED=1`:
  ```sh
  cd ios && RCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED=1 pod install
  ```

**That's it.** The same `@dashx/react-native` package and the same JavaScript API work on both architectures — no code changes in your app.

#### 5. Initialize the SDK in your app entry file

Call `DashX.configure()` once, as early as possible — ideally in your root component's `useEffect` or in `index.js` before `AppRegistry.registerComponent`.

```ts
import DashX from '@dashx/react-native';

DashX.configure({
  publicKey: 'YOUR_DASHX_PUBLIC_KEY',
});
```

#### 6. Rebuild your app

```sh
# iOS
npx react-native run-ios

# Android
npx react-native run-android
```

### AI Agent Installation

🤖 If you use an AI coding assistant (Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Cline, Aider, etc.), hand off the entire installation to the agent. **Copy the prompt below, paste it into your agent, and it will perform every step end-to-end in your project.**

The prompt is self-contained — it tells the agent what to install, where to put things, what to verify, and what to do if something fails. You only need to provide your **DashX public key** when asked.

> **ℹ️ Hover over the code block below to reveal the copy button in the top-right corner.** The prompt is intentionally strict about verification steps and never-do rules so the agent won't downgrade your RN version, corrupt your lockfile, set up Firebase on your behalf, or commit secrets.

#### 📋 Copy this prompt into your AI agent

Here's a preview of the first few lines — expand the section below to see the full prompt and copy it.

================================================================
CONTEXT
================================================================

`@dashx/react-native` is the official DashX SDK for React Native. It's a TurboModule that works on both React Native's Old Architecture and New Architecture from a single install. It provides analytics, content management, push notifications, deep linking, and asset management — all backed by native iOS and Android SDKs.

- npm package: @dashx/react-native
- Minimum React Native: 0.74.0
- Minimum iOS deployment target: 13.0
- Minimum Android minSdkVersion: 26
- Requires Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications
- NOT compatible with Expo Go — if this is an Expo project, the user must be using a development build

================================================================
STEP 1 — VERIFY PREREQUISITES
================================================================

Before installing, verify the project meets all requirements:

1. Read package.json and confirm react-native version is >=0.74.0.
   - If lower, STOP and report — the user needs to upgrade React Native first.

2. Confirm this is NOT an Expo Go project:
   - If app.json / app.config.js exists and the project uses Expo, confirm a development build is in use (check for expo-dev-client in dependencies, or prebuild output in ios/ and android/ directories).
   - If it's pure Expo Go, STOP and tell the user they must migrate to a development build first.

3. Read ios/Podfile and confirm platform :ios, '13.0' or higher.

4. Read android/build.gradle (project-level) and confirm minSdkVersion = 26 or higher.

5. Detect the package manager:
   - yarn.lock exists → use yarn
   - pnpm-lock.yaml exists → use pnpm
   - otherwise → use npm

6. Detect whether the project uses New Architecture:
   - Check android/gradle.properties for newArchEnabled=true
   - Check ios/Podfile for RCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED=1 env usage

Report the detected values back to me and wait for confirmation before continuing.

================================================================
STEP 2 — INSTALL THE PACKAGE
================================================================

Install @dashx/react-native using the detected package manager. Do NOT use a different package manager than the one the project already uses — that will corrupt the lockfile.

  npm install @dashx/react-native
  yarn add @dashx/react-native
  pnpm add @dashx/react-native

================================================================
STEP 3 — INSTALL iOS PODS
================================================================

From the project root:

  cd ios && pod install && cd ..

If New Architecture was detected in Step 1:

  cd ios && RCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED=1 pod install && cd ..

Verify the pod was installed by checking that ios/Pods/DashX/ and related DashX-prefixed directories exist under ios/Pods/. If the pod install fails with a message about DashX iOS SDK not being found, DashXReactNative.podspec depends on pod 'DashX', '~> 1.1.9' — make sure CocoaPods can reach the spec repo (pod repo update may help).

================================================================
STEP 4 — VERIFY FIREBASE IS CONFIGURED
================================================================

The SDK's push notification feature requires Firebase Cloud Messaging on both platforms. Check:

iOS:
- File ios/<AppName>/GoogleService-Info.plist exists.
- The file is added to the Xcode project target.

Android:
- File android/app/google-services.json exists.
- android/build.gradle (project-level) has the Google Services classpath: classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.x.x' (or newer).
- android/app/build.gradle has apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services' at the bottom.

If Firebase is NOT configured, do NOT try to set it up yourself — STOP and tell the user:
  "Firebase Cloud Messaging is not configured in this project. Please follow https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging to add GoogleService-Info.plist (iOS) and google-services.json (Android), then re-run this installation."

If Firebase IS configured, continue.

================================================================
STEP 5 — INITIALIZE THE SDK IN THE APP ENTRY FILE
================================================================

Find the app's entry file. Look for these in order:
  1. App.tsx or App.jsx at the project root
  2. src/App.tsx or src/App.jsx
  3. index.js at the project root

In the entry file:

1. Add the import at the top with the other imports:

     import DashX from '@dashx/react-native';

2. Call DashX.configure() once, as early as possible in the app lifecycle. The recommended pattern is inside a useEffect with an empty dependency array in the root component:

     import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
     import DashX from '@dashx/react-native';

     export default function App() {
       useEffect(() => {
         DashX.configure({
           publicKey: 'YOUR_DASHX_PUBLIC_KEY',
           // Optional:
           // baseURI: 'https://your-self-hosted-dashx.com',
           // targetEnvironment: 'staging',
         });
       }, []);

       return /* existing return */;
     }

3. Do NOT hardcode the public key. If the project has an env-loading library (react-native-config, react-native-dotenv, @env, or process.env via Babel plugin), use that. Otherwise, ask the user for the public key and add a TODO comment explaining where to put it securely. NEVER commit a real public key to git.

4. If the user has no env setup, add the key as a placeholder literal ('YOUR_DASHX_PUBLIC_KEY') and tell the user to replace it before running.

================================================================
STEP 6 — WIRE UP PUSH & DEEP LINK LISTENERS (ASK FIRST)
================================================================

Ask the user: "Do you want me to wire up push notification and deep link listeners now? (yes/no)"

If yes, add listener setup and cleanup inside the same useEffect:

  useEffect(() => {
    DashX.configure({ publicKey: 'YOUR_DASHX_PUBLIC_KEY' });

    DashX.subscribe(); // register device for push

    const messageSub = DashX.onMessageReceived((message) => {
      console.log('[DashX] Push received:', message);
    });

    const linkSub = DashX.onLinkReceived((url) => {
      console.log('[DashX] Deep link:', url);
    });

    return () => {
      messageSub.remove();
      linkSub.remove();
    };
  }, []);

If no, skip this step.

================================================================
STEP 7 — TYPESCRIPT SETUP (IF APPLICABLE)
================================================================

If the project uses TypeScript (tsconfig.json exists):

1. Verify the @dashx/react-native import resolves without errors. The package ships its own types via index.d.ts — no @types/... package is needed.

2. Run the project's TypeScript check command (usually tsc --noEmit or npm run typecheck / yarn tsc) and confirm there are no new errors introduced by the DashX imports.

================================================================
STEP 8 — CLEAN AND REBUILD
================================================================

Instruct the user to run a clean rebuild. Do NOT try to run the app yourself — just prepare the commands:

  # iOS
  cd ios && pod install && cd ..
  npx react-native run-ios

  # Android
  cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..
  npx react-native run-android

================================================================
STEP 9 — VERIFY INSTALLATION
================================================================

After the user reports a successful build:

1. Ask the user to check the device/emulator console for any error messages containing "DashX" or "The package '@dashx/react-native' doesn't seem to be linked".

2. Ask the user to trigger a simple test event to confirm the pipeline works:

     DashX.track('installation_test', { timestamp: Date.now() });

3. Ask the user to confirm the event shows up in the DashX dashboard under Events within a minute or two.

If any step fails, consult the Troubleshooting section of the @dashx/react-native README or ask the user to run with DashX.setLogLevel(2) (debug mode) and share the logs.

================================================================
RULES — STRICTLY ENFORCE
================================================================

DO NOT:
- Edit yarn.lock / package-lock.json / pnpm-lock.yaml by hand. Let the package manager handle them.
- Run pod install on a project that uses Expo Go (non-dev-build).
- Commit real secrets (public keys, tokens) to the repo.
- Downgrade React Native, iOS deployment target, or Android minSdkVersion. If the project doesn't meet the requirements, STOP and report.
- Skip Step 1 (prerequisite verification).
- Install a different DashX package. The package name is exactly @dashx/react-native.

DO:
- Use the project's existing package manager.
- Preserve the user's existing code and imports when modifying the entry file.
- Add a TODO comment next to the public key placeholder if no env setup exists.
- Report what you did at each step so the user can verify.

Begin with Step 1.
```

## TypeScript Support

The SDK ships with full TypeScript definitions in [`index.d.ts`](./index.d.ts). You get autocomplete, type-checking, and inline documentation for every method and option.

```ts
import DashX, {
  type ConfigureOptions,
  type IdentifyOptions,
  type FetchRecordOptions,
  type SearchRecordsOptions,
  type NotificationMessage,
  type NavigationAction,
  type NotificationPermissionStatus,
  DashXErrorCode,
} from '@dashx/react-native';

// Strongly-typed configuration
const options: ConfigureOptions = {
  publicKey: 'pk_live_…',
  targetEnvironment: 'production',
};
DashX.configure(options);

// Typed navigation actions
const action: NavigationAction = { type: 'deepLink', url: 'myapp://home' };
DashX.trackNotificationNavigation(action, 'notif-123');

// Typed search options
const results = await DashX.searchRecords('articles', {
  filter: { status: 'published' },
  limit: 10,
  page: 1,
  include: [{ author: {} }],
});
```

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>🔴 "The package '@dashx/react-native' doesn't seem to be linked"</strong></summary>

This error comes from the fallback `Proxy` in `index.js` and means the native module wasn't found at runtime.

**Fix:**
1. Make sure you ran `pod install` in the `ios/` directory.
2. Rebuild the app after installing the package (`npx react-native run-ios` / `run-android`).
3. Verify you are **not** using Expo Go — use a development build instead.
4. On Android, make sure your `gradle.properties` and `settings.gradle` haven't been modified in a way that disables autolinking.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🔴 "Method xxx not found on DashXReactNative" (Android)</strong></summary>

From **1.2.0** onwards, the 4 Android parity-gap methods (`uploadAsset`, `fetchAsset`, `requestNotificationPermission`, `getNotificationPermissionStatus`) now reject with the code `EUNSUPPORTED` instead of throwing `Method not found`. If you see the old error, you're on a pre-1.2.0 version — upgrade.

If you need these methods on Android today, wrap the call and handle the rejection:

```ts
try {
  await DashX.uploadAsset(path, 'products', 'image');
} catch (err: any) {
  if (err.code === 'EUNSUPPORTED' && Platform.OS === 'android') {
    // Fallback to an HTTP upload endpoint
  }
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🔴 "DashX.configure: publicKey is required"</strong></summary>

You called `configure` without a valid `publicKey` string. Double-check you're passing the right env variable and that it's loaded before your SDK call.

```ts
DashX.configure({ publicKey: process.env.DASHX_PUBLIC_KEY! });
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🔴 Android FCM service conflict</strong></summary>

The SDK's `AndroidManifest.xml` registers `DashXReactNativeFirebaseMessagingService` as the highest-priority FCM service. If push notifications aren't being delivered:

1. Rebuild the app to pick up manifest changes.
2. Make sure your own app doesn't register a competing `FirebaseMessagingService` with higher priority.
3. Verify `google-services.json` is present and the Google Services Gradle plugin is applied.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🔴 iOS-only methods appear to do nothing on Android</strong></summary>

This is intentional. `enableLifecycleTracking`, `enableAdTracking`, `processURL`, and `trackNotificationNavigation` are iOS-only and early-return on Android at the JavaScript layer. Use `Platform.OS === 'ios'` guards if you need to branch explicitly in your code.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🔴 New Architecture build fails on Android with "cannot find NativeDashXReactNativeSpec"</strong></summary>

This means Gradle codegen hasn't generated the spec file yet. Try:

```sh
cd android
./gradlew clean
./gradlew generateCodegenArtifactsFromSchema
```

Then rebuild. If the error persists, make sure `newArchEnabled=true` is in `android/gradle.properties` of your **consumer app** (not in the library's build.gradle).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🔴 iOS new-arch build fails with "does not conform to protocol NativeDashXReactNativeSpec"</strong></summary>

This happens when codegen generates a protocol method signature that doesn't match what's in `DashXReactNative.swift`. Inspect the generated header:

```
ios/Pods/Headers/Public/RNDashXReactNativeSpec/RNDashXReactNativeSpec.h
```

Compare the protocol method signatures with the Swift `@objc(...)` selectors. If they don't match, open an issue with the exact signatures from the generated header — we'll ship a fix.
</details>

## Versioning & Breaking Changes

This SDK follows **semantic versioning**. Breaking changes are only introduced in major versions (e.g., 1.x → 2.x), with the one exception of the **1.2.0** release which is a minor bump containing a narrow but intentional breaking change:

### 1.2.0 — TurboModule Migration

- ✅ **New Architecture / TurboModule support** (dual-arch, single codebase).
- ⚠️ **Minimum React Native version bumped to 0.74.0** (was 0.71.0).
- ⚠️ **Android: class rename** — `DashXPackage` → `DashXReactNativePackage` (fixes a long-standing filename/classname mismatch). Apps using autolinking are unaffected. Apps manually registering the package in `MainApplication` must update their import.
- 🐛 **iOS bug fix**: `processURL` and `trackNotificationNavigation` are now properly exposed to JS (were implemented in Swift but missing from the bridge header).
- 🐛 **iOS bug fix**: `setLogLevel` bridge signature corrected from `(int *)` (pointer type) to `(double)`, so the level value is now marshalled correctly.
- 🆕 **Android parity stubs**: calls to `uploadAsset`, `fetchAsset`, `requestNotificationPermission`, and `getNotificationPermissionStatus` on Android now reject with `EUNSUPPORTED` instead of throwing `Method not found`. Consistent failure mode across arches.
